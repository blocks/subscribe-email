Subscribe Email is a UMD JavaScript module for rendering a mailing list sign up form quickly on a webpage.

It allows developers to quickly include an email collection form on a page without being concerned with the implementation details of a specific mailing list platform. We're currently aiming to support mailing lists on SendGrid, MailChimp and Universe.

# Getting the Module
You can get the module in any one of the following ways;
- Download [the latest release](https://github.com/blocks/subscribe-email/releases) from GitHub
- Or install with npm; `npm install subscribe-email`
- Or install with Bower; `bower install subscribe-email`

# Quick Start
To get started, you'll need to include the script on your page, create a `<form>` element, and initialize the module. Here's some minimal code you can use to get started quickly;

```
<script src="subscribe-email.js">
```


```
<form id="subscribe-form"></form>
```


```
<script>
new SubscribeEmail({
  element: '#subscribe-form',
  service: 'universe',
  key: 'your-api-key-here'
});
</script>
```

At a minimum, you'll need to change the `service` and `key` parameters to match your needs.

# Advanced Usage

## Options
The module can be configured with several optional parameters passed to it's constructor. Here is the full list of options:

### `element`
**(Required)** A DOM element, jQuery element, or selector string to refer to the placeholder element.

### `service`
**(Required)** The mailing list platform you are using. Available options are `mailchimp`, `sendgrid` and `universe`.

### `key`
**(Required)** A string of the API key for your mailing list platform.

### `submitText`
A string to be used on the form's submit button (defaults to "Subscribe").

### `overrideTemplate`
Set this to true to override the markup that is automatically generated by the plugin. See "Customizing the Template" below (defaults to `false`).

### `responseElement`
A selector string for the element you want to display response (validation, errors, confirmation) messages from your platform's API (defaults to `'.subscribe-email__response'`).

### `async`
Whether the form with be submitted asynchronously (defaults to `true`).

## Customizing the Template
Out of the box, the Subscribe Email module will generate BEM markup with the namespace `subscribe-email` that contains all of the elements your form needs. If you want to customize the markup, set `overrideTemplate: true` when you initialize the module to use the markup from the target element instead. This gives you full control over the markup, but you'll have to make sure that your form contains all of the required fields.

## Events
Some mailing list platforms may send response messages for things like confirmation or validation errors. The default template will display these messages along-side the form, but alternatively you can easily integrate the messages into other parts of your page by listening for the following events to fire on the form element;

- `subscriptionMessage`: Fires whenever the mailing list provider returns a response (both success and failure).
- `subscriptionError`: This event will fire if the mailing list provider returns an error. Specific details about the error will be included in a payload object when available.
- `subscriptionSuccess`: This event will fire if the mailing list provider returns a confirmation that the email address has been added to the list. Specific details will be included in a payload object when available.
